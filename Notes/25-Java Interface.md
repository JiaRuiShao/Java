## Java Interface

Another way to achieve abstraction in Java, is with interfaces.

An `interface` is a completely "**abstract class**" that is used to group related methods with empty bodies:

```java
// interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void run(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}
```

To access the interface methods, the interface must be "implemented" (kinda like inherited) by another class with the `implements` keyword (instead of `extends`). The body of the interface method is provided by the "implement" class:

```java
// Interface
interface Animal {
  public void animalSound(); // interface method (does not have a body)
  public void sleep(); // interface method (does not have a body)
}

// Pig "implements" the Animal interface
class Pig implements Animal {
  public void animalSound() {
    // The body of animalSound() is provided here
    System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
  }
  public void sleep() {
    // The body of sleep() is provided here
    System.out.println("Zzz");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Pig myPig = new Pig();  // Create a Pig object
    myPig.animalSound();
    myPig.sleep();
  }
}

```

**Notes on Interfaces**:

- Like **abstract classes**, interfaces **cannot** be used to create objects (in the example above, it is not possible to create an "Animal" object in the MyMainClass)
- Interface methods does not have a body - the body is provided by the "implement" class
- On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
- Interface methods are by default abstract and public
- Interface attributes are by default public, static and final
- An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)

**Why And When To Use Interfaces**?

1) To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object (interface).

2) Java does not support "multiple inheritance" (a class can only inherit from one superclass). However, it can be achieved with interfaces, because **the class can implement multiple interfaces** (To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma).

### Multiple Interfaces

To implement multiple interfaces, separate them with a comma:

```java
interface FirstInterface {
  public void myMethod(); // interface method
}

interface SecondInterface {
  public void myOtherMethod(); // interface method
}

// DemoClass "implements" FirstInterface and SecondInterface
class DemoClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface {
  public void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some text..");
  }
  public void myOtherMethod() {
    System.out.println("Some other text...");
  }
}

class MyMainClass {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();
    myObj.myMethod();
    myObj.myOtherMethod();
  }
}
```
