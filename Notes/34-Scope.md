## Scope

A method is a task that an object of a class performs.

We mark the domain of this task using curly braces: `{`, and `}`. Everything inside the curly braces is part of the task. This domain is called the scope of a method.

We canâ€™t access variables that are declared inside a method in code that is outside the scope of that method.

Looking at the `Car` class again:

```java
class Car {
  String color;
  int milesDriven;

  public Car(String carColor) {
    color = carColor;
    milesDriven = 0;         
  }

  public void drive() {
     String message = "Miles driven: " + milesDriven;
     System.out.println(message);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args){
     Car myFastCar = new Car("red");
     myFastCar.drive();
  }
}
```


The variable `message`, which is declared and initialized inside of `drive`, cannot be used inside of `main()`! It only exists within the scope of the `drive()` method.

However, `milesDriven`, which is declared at the top of the class, can be used inside all methods in the class, since it is in the scope of the whole class.
